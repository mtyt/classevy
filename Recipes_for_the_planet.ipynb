        "# Our World In Data: Environmental Impacts of Food Production\n",
        "The brilliant [Our World In Data](https://ourworldindata.org) published an article that shows how what we eat impacts the environment. For a number of foods - I think about 200 - they collected the CO2 emissions, land use, water use, [eutrophication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eutrophication) per kg but also per 100 g of protein, 100 g of fat and per 1000 kcal. This way, they created some interesting grahps which yield insights into which foods are better for the planet than others, and which are very bad ([BEEF!](https://ourworldindata.org/explorers/food-footprints?facet=none&hideControls=false&Commodity+or+Specific+Food+Product=Commodity&Environmental+Impact=Carbon+footprint&Kilogram+%2F+Protein+%2F+Calories=Per+kilogram&By+stage+of+supply+chain=false&country=Bananas~Beef+%28beef+herd%29~Beef+%28dairy+herd%29~Cheese~Eggs~Lamb+%26+Mutton~Milk~Maize~Nuts~Pig+Meat~Peas~Potatoes~Poultry+Meat~Rice~Tomatoes~Wheat+%26+Rye~Tofu+%28soybeans%29~Prawns+%28farmed%29)).\n",

        "However, this isn't a very practical way of deciding what you will eat for dinner tonight! You can think: \"oh perhaps I will have some beer and some peas!\" and then look up the environmental impact. But how many kilograms of beer and peas will you need for a healthy diet?\n",
        "That's where this Notebook comes in.\n",
        "I wanted to reverse the question and solve the problem: I want to consume just enough food to satisfy my nutritional needs (kcal, fat and protein) at the lowest environmental impact possible, what should I eat?\n",
        "\n",
        "In order to solve this question, I'm using a [genetic algorithm (GA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_algorithm), which I implemented in a Python package, available on GitHub, called [`optime`](https://github.com/mtyt/optime), to optimize your diet towards minimal environmetal impact, while satisfying your healthy nutritional needs!\n",

        "- [First](#one-food), I will take a simplified case where you're going to eat only 1 type of food every day. Which food should it be to consume enough calories, fat and protein, while having the minimum environmental impact possible?\n",
